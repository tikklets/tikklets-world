# ðŸŒŽ Tikklets | Tiny Projects

This repository is **Tikklets World**, a collection of tiny, experimental projectsâ€”one of **tikklets**â€”created through trial and error.

### ðŸ’¡ What are Tikklets?

A "tikklet" is the singular noun for a **tiny existence** to do **tiny projects**.
So, "tikklets" is the plural noun of tikklet.

This space documents the journey in quickly prototyping ideas, testing new libraries, and exploring technical concepts without the commitment of building a full-scale application. It's a living sandbox where curiosity meets code.

### ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure & Exploration

The projects are typically organized by their primary technology or focus area. You can dive into any folder to see the source code, implementation notes, and the outcome (or failure!) of the experiment.

- **`/[Project-Name-1]`**: _Example: A simple Python script for data processing._
    
- **`/[Technology-Focus-2]`**: _Example: A quick proof-of-concept using React hooks._
    
- **`/[Experimental-Concept]`**: _Example: Vanilla JavaScript implementation of a custom UI component._
    

#### How to Use This Repo:

1. **Explore:** Browse the folders to see the projects. Each project folder should contain its own focused `README.md` with specific details on setup and purpose.
    
2. **Learn:** The primary value here is the **process**. Feel free to check the commit history to see the trial-and-error steps taken to reach the final state.
    

> **Note:** These are proofs-of-concept and small experiments, not production-ready code. They are messy, functional (mostly!), and meant for learning.
